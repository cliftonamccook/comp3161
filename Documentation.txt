OVERVIEW OF PROBLEM BEING SOLVED BY THE DATABASE

    The Ministry of Education is tasked with lending books out of its libraries. Currently, the data for those who are on this 
    lending programme are small, but overtime, we expect it gain traction. As such, we are being proactive in designing a database 
    that can also help them to maintain the programme. This will aid the organisation in keeping track of 
    
    i)Books and their information
    ii) the borrowers of said books
    iii) fines associated with each account
    iv) list of members




TECHNICAL CHALLENGES
    There was no technological difficulty in creating this database.





IMPLEMENTATION OF DATABASE
    1. Data Security
        This database is currently no security system in place for this database.
        In the future,We advocate using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) which provides a role to each user.
        user. This is the greatest option since it requires the system to retain a level of hieriarchy. We don't want 
        an Entry Clerk Level I, for example, to be allowed to modify Publishers' table. 
        We also encourage end users to limit the number of perople who have access to this database.
        Any member, publisher, author or borrower will not be harmed by the information gathered.
